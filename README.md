# Travel Blog Project 🌍✈️  

I’m currently working on a personal project — a **Travel Blog**.  
I actually built two versions of the same idea:  

- **Version 1:** plain **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**  
- **Version 2:** using **React**  

I’m still not sure which direction to continue, so I’d love to get some **feedback** or maybe even **collaborate** with other developers.  

This project is just for **practice and experience**, and I think it could be fun to work on it together and learn along the way. 🚀  

If you’re interested, feel free to open an issue, start a discussion, or just reach out!
