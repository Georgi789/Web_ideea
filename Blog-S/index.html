        My first and I hope not the last üòÖ adventure was a trip in Asia. I
        planned with my boyfriend this trip for a couple of months, and it was
        an unforgettable experience!
      </p>

        We start with a visit in Philippines, where we explored the beautiful
        beaches of Puerto Princesa, Palawan, El Nido, Coron, Moalboal and the
        vibrant city of Manila. The food was absolutely amazing, with fresh
        seafood and local delicacies that we couldn't get enough of!
      </p>
      <p>
        After that, we headed to Thailand, where we visited Bangkok and Chiang
        Mai. We explored the bustling markets, visited stunning temples, and
        even took a cooking class to learn how to make some of our favorite Thai
        dishes.
